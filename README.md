# Package Pricing ML

Machine learning application to learn product valuations for package pricing optimization.

## Project Overview
This project develops ML models to understand customer valuations of products and optimize bundle pricing strategies. It uses transaction data, customer behavior, market research, and competitive analysis to generate optimal pricing recommendations.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `src/`: Source code organized by function
- `tests/`: Unit tests for code validation

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Collection
The project uses the following data sources:
- E-commerce transaction data
- Customer behavior data
- Market research surveys
- Competitor pricing information

See `src/data/README.md` for more details on data collection.
